I built this project as a freelancer in cooperation with crafted.me.
It's a tool that shows social media entries from different platforms.
I used <a href="https://github.com/componentjs/component">component </a> as a buildtool, module registry and uses backbone.js without jQuery. 
A <a href="https://github.com/namjul/layout">layout library</a> was built for positioning the entries.
