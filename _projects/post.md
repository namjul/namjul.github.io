The Austrian Post did a complete relaunch of their main website in 2014.
I was responsible for the whole frontend development
using Bootstrap and a modular approach with webpack, NPM and commonJS.
A technical styleguide was added as a reference document.

Further, the <a href="https://www.post.at/footer_allgemein_newsletter.php">newsletter</a> 
subscribe page was built as an embedded spa with backbone.js.
